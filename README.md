Specs
CPU: i5 8250U
GPU: Intel UHD 620
GPU2: Nvidia Geforce 940MX

This EFI works best with Ventura, so I will only be updating OC but not 
the OS. **Perhaps**

Sleep only works ~~with the power adapter unplugged~~ perfectly fine 
after changing SMBIOS to 15,2.

Replaced the wifi card with "Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 3165"
